  "text": "<h2><q><strong>Supporting human mobility by data mobility</strong></q></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>New mobility concepts and better data networking are both crucial factors for global economic development. To invent innovative and sustainable mobility concepts, new data-based value-added services are required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Route Planning</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Route planning taking into account places of interest, energy saving aspects (e.g. for electric vehicles) or complex travel arrangements</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Multimodal Mobility</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Linking various multimodal mobility services with regard to complex environment conditions and current or forecast events like weather or traffic volume</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Alternative Scenarios</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Dynamic and interactive planning of alternative mobility services in the event of unforeseen circumstances (e.g. breakdown in public transport, congestions)</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>To implement such innovative data-based services for mobility support it is necessary to link and integrate data coming from a vast number of different sources. Some examples are map data, vehicle data, weather data, mobilityservice descriptions or events information. These data sets come from various stakeholders and organisations and they often have proprietary data structures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our goal is to significantly improve the data mobility between all stakeholders by providing a standardized vocabulary using Semantic Web technologies and ontologies. For the open vocabulary covering various mobility aspects weuse RDF (Resource Description Framework) - a recommended specification of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the so-called lingua franca for the integration of data and web. We invite everyone who is interested to join ourMobiVoc initiative and to participate in the development of the Open Mobility Vocabulary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Logo: ITA\" src=\"http://www.ita-int.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ita_logo_left_small-110x59.png\" style=\"height:22px; width:40px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>MobiVoc is a project of <a href=\"http://www.ita-int.org\">ITA</a> in cooperation with our <a href=\"partners.html\">partners</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click <a href=\"https://github.com/lavhal/testProj\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> for more about GitHub repository.</p>\r\n"
